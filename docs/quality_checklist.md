# Quality checklist (maintained by QA / Critic)

Score each canonical viewpoint 0-5 per criterion after every round. Target: every viewpoint >= 4 on every row,
hero (cam_01) >= 4.5 average. Anything that reads as "game asset" or "clean CAD" is a reject regardless of score.

| Criterion | What 5 means |
|---|---|
| Silhouette match | Overlay of render on reference photo: dome, drum, attic, entablature, column edges align within ~2% of frame height. |
| Proportion | Vertical stack (pedestal / column / entablature / attic / drum / dome) and octagon width match measured ratios. |
| Ornament fidelity | Capitals, frieze, maidens, urns, rosettes recognisable as the PFA's specific ornament, not generic classical. |
| Material realism | Concrete reads as cast, weathered, variegated ochre; columns dusty terracotta; no plastic sheen, no flat color. |
| Edge wear | Corners softened, rain streaks, algae line at water, patches, dust in recesses. Visible at hero distance. |
| Lighting mood | Low warm sun, long soft-edged shadows, sky-lit blue shade, warm haze in the distance, no crushed blacks. |
| Water reflection | Reflection broken by ripples, green-tinted murk, Fresnel falloff, correct brightness vs. sky. |
| Repetition visibility | No two ornament instances identical at hero distance; no visible tiling in materials. |
| Scale cues | Trees, shrubs, birds, railings, steps at believable sizes; nothing reads as miniature or giant. |

Also reported every round (not scored 0-5, pass/fail against the brief's Phase 5 deliverables): **Viewport performance**
(master.blend open time < 60 s, viewport LOD1 triangle count, Eevee preview seconds per QA camera) and **Deliverables present**
(Cycles final config, Eevee viewport config, flythrough bezier path `CAM_flythrough_path`; at Phase 5 also the 3840x2160 Cycles
hero and the low-res Eevee test animation).

## Round log
(QA appends a dated section per round: scores table per camera, defects with camera id and measurable fix.)

### Round 01 — 2026-09-07 (Phase 2 gate; materials still placeholders)

Full report: `docs/qa_round_01.md`. Evidence: `renders/qa_comparisons/round01_*` (per-camera three-panel sheets, contact sheet,
Cycles hero vs ref 169, and the new W_a-aligned overlays `round01_cam01_aligned_vs_ref169.png` / `_vs_user.png`).
Renders: `renders/previews/qa/round01_*` (Eevee 1280x720 x6, Cycles 1920x1080 hero, 65 s).

| row | cam01 | cam02 | cam03 | cam04 | cam05 | cam06 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Silhouette match | 3 | 1 | 1.5 | 4 | 1.5 | 3 |
| Proportion | 3 | 3 | 3.5 | 4 | 3.5 | 3.5 |
| Ornament fidelity | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2.5 | 2.5 | 3 |
| Material realism | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| Edge wear | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Lighting mood | 3.5 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 2.5 |
| Water reflection | 1 | n/a | 1 | n/a | 1 | 1.5 |
| Repetition visibility | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| Scale cues | 3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2.5 | 3 |
| average | 2.2 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 2.3 | 1.9 | 2.2 |

Verdict: gate not passed for photorealism (no materials yet), but the rotunda body is right: with attic width and corner row
aligned, pedestal-to-attic-cornice edges sit within ~1-2 % of frame height of refs 169 and the user image.

Blockers: **QA-01-1** dome + drum too low/flat (visible rise 0.161 W_a vs 0.195-0.30 in five photos; apex 6.3 % of frame height
low vs ref 169; owner architecture, lead arbitrates vs the sheet's 49.4 m apex). **QA-01-2** shoreline shrubs are polygon slabs
(environment). **QA-01-3** water is a flat brown mirror (materials + environment).
Majors: QA-01-4 hero framing (shoreline at 86 % frame height vs 69 % / 53 %; lead), QA-01-5 cams 02/03/05 miscalibrated (lead),
QA-01-6 tree placement + missing redwood screen (environment), QA-01-7 leaf cards (environment), QA-01-8 hall backdrop box in
the hero arch (environment), QA-01-9 Eevee ceiling 4x too dark, no light probes (lighting), QA-01-10 Zimm panels ~15 % figure
coverage vs ~70 % (ornament), QA-01-11 podium Greek-key band missing (ornament + architecture), QA-01-17 placeholders (materials,
expected).
Minors: QA-01-12..16, 18..20 (see report).

Tools added: `scripts/qa_render_round.py` (round renderer, `--eevee` / `--final`), `scripts/qa_silhouette.py`
(silhouette measure + W_a-aligned overlay; use it for the 2 % silhouette test).
